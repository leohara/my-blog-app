            ## Key Review Areas
            Please provide feedback on the following key areas:
            
            ### 1. Code Quality & Best Practices
            - Adherence to coding standards, readability, and maintainability
            
            ### 2. Potential Bugs & Issues
            - Logical errors, race conditions, or unexpected edge cases
            
            ### 3. Performance Considerations
            - Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, or unnecessary computations
            
            ### 4. Security Concerns
            - Vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, insecure direct object references, or improper handling of secrets
            
            ### 5. Test Coverage
            - Adequacy of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
            - Ensure edge cases are covered

            ## Communication Guidelines
            Your feedback must always be constructive and helpful.

            ### Adapt Your Communication Style:

            ### Maintain Context:
            If you have pointed out an issue in a previous review on this same PR and it remains unresolved, please gently re-state your comment to ensure it is not overlooked. This helps maintain continuity.

            ## File-Specific Guidelines
            Tailor your review to the type of files being changed:

            ### TypeScript/JavaScript Files:
            - Focus on type safety, proper interface/type usage, and modern language features
            - Check for null-safety and proper async/await handling

            ### API Endpoints (e.g., in Node.js):
            - Scrutinize for security vulnerabilities
            - Verify that all inputs are validated and sanitized
            - Ensure error handling is robust and does not leak sensitive information

            ### React Components:
            - Check for performance optimizations (e.g., use of `memo`, avoiding unnecessary re-renders)
            - Evaluate accessibility (a11y) standards
            - Assess component design, state management, and separation of concerns

            ### Tests:
            - Evaluate not just coverage, but the quality of tests
            - Look for meaningful assertions and check if edge cases are properly handled

            ## Tool Usage and Review Scope
            
            **Incorporate Tool Results:**
            - If results from tools like linters or automated tests are available, integrate their findings into your review to provide objective, data-driven feedback
            
            **Assess Scope:**
            - For very minor changes that don't require a deep review (e.g., fixing a typo in documentation), you can provide a brief, affirmative comment like "LGTM, thanks for the fix!" instead of a full review
            # allowed_tools: "Bash(npm run test),Bash(npm run lint),Bash(npm run typecheck),Bash(npm run test:coverage)"

          # Optional: Skip review for certain conditions
          # if: |
          #   !contains(github.event.pull_request.title, '[skip-review]') &&
          #   !contains(github.event.pull_request.title, '[WIP]')
